## symlinks-index

- unit tests for StartsWith
- integration test with test-data/symlinks-index/

## priorities

- Make integration test not depend on the mtime values of my local checkout.
- The string OPEN must only be matched with word boundaries before and after.
- With mtime > 30 days, pin to the top (with coloring?).
- Hierarchical tasks (subtasks).
