# ChJ's Rust bin

Tools similar to the ones in [chj-scripts](https://github.com/pflanze/chj-scripts) but implemented in Rust instead of Perl or shell.

Let me know if you'd like to package some of these in a distro, or would otherwise like to separate them out. I'll be happy to move them into their own repository.
